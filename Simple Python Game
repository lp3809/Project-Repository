-This Little Script defines 3 functions
-there is then a little script at the end for the player to actually interact and play the game
-Below is the script

# this is a game guessing where the ball or "O" is in a list
# the first section defines 3 functions: 

#1.) to shuffle a list where the ball's location is
#2.) to prompt user for input which includes a verifier to make sure the player selects an index in range of the list
#3.) to check if the player hit the correct index, if not; it will display the location of the ball to the user

# RESULT: once ran, the game will display if a person is correct or incorrect with the correct location of the ball displayed.
